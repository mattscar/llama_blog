I've been reading *Genius Makers: The Mavericks Who Brought AI to Google, Facebook, and the World* by Cade Metz, and I'm enjoying it immensely. It covers the history of machine learning from Frank Rosenblatt's perceptrons to the present day, and though it doesn't go into technical depth, it provides a fascinating look at the personalities and companies involved. 

The book focuses on a handful of AI researchers, presenting their work and their dealings with corporations. It discusses the formation of DeepMind, its acquisition by Google, and the extraordinary performance of AlphaGo. It presents Yann LeCun's work on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and explains how he ended up at Facebook (now Meta). It also covers the bizarre formation of OpenAI, which was originally founded to serve humanity, but is now concerned with serving its shareholders.
